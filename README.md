============

Each of these in two different languages, without reference:

1. Implement binary search on sorted lists.

2. Implement two different sort functions (bonus points if one of them is mergesort or quicksort).

3. Implement a tree (binary tree is a good one to start with), give it the ability to add an element, remove an element, print out all elements in sorted order.

4. Treating the tree as a graph (or modify it to be a graph if you want, no longer binary tree), implement depth-first search and breadth-first search for a node.

5. Implement a hash table, make sure you can insert more elements than there are "buckets" without losing data.

If you get stuck, move on to the next one. If you're still stuck once you're done, you can check a reference. :) Try to implement it in the 2nd language without reference, though.
